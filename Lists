 ## Lists:
Lists are a multiple variables stored inside of one variable, for instance:
spam = ['one', 1, 'two', 2.0, True]
They can store strings, ints, floats and booleans.
You can use loops like in, for and while to iterate, make logical statements or infinite loop in lists:
for i in spam:
  print(i)
 ## Methods for lists
You can also use method like range, len, nameOfList.index(value_u_re_lookin_for), append('val'), someList.insert(position, value)
someList.remove('value), .sort() or .sort(reverse=True)
 ## Anotha knowledge brotha
Lists have indexes, like spam[0], spam[1]. U can take a slice of a list like spam[0,1]. U can take every second value of a list [0,-1,2]
Indexes can be used to change variable inside of list like: spam[1] = 1.0
U can concatenate or replicate a list. Conc: spam + spam or spam += [someValue]. Replicate: spam * 3
